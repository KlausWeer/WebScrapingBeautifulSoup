#What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching the HTML content of a web page and then using code to parse and extract relevant information from that HTML. Web scraping is commonly used for various purposes, such as data mining, market research, competitive analysis, etc.

#Steps to follow

##1. Sending a Request to the website you want to scrape.

The first step is to go ahead and send a *request* to the website you'd like to scrape. This is typically done using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Python libraries like requests are commonly used for this purpose.

##2. Parse the HTML.

What does this mean? Parsing, in the context of web scraping, refers to the process of analyzing the structure of a document, often in a markup language like HTML or XML, and extracting relevant information from it. When you fetch the HTML content of a web page, it is essentially a text document with a specific structure defined by tags, attributes, and content. Parsing involves breaking down this structured document into its components to make it more accessible and usable.

Once the HTML is parsed, you can navigate through the document's structure and search for specific elements using the parser's functions.
Common methods include *find()*, *find_all()*, *select()*, etc., which allow you to locate HTML tags based on their names, attributes, or other criteria.

##3. Extracting the Data

Here you locate and scrape out the relevant data that you are interested in with the use of the parser's tools.

##4. Storing the Data

Once the data is extracted, you can store it in a file (such as CSV, Excel, or a database) or use it for further analysis, reporting, or any other desired purpose.
